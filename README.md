# CSM

# About

The CSM program calculates continuous symmetry and chirality measures of molecules with respect to a given point group G. Molecular coordinates can be provided in either xyz, sdf, mol or pdb format.
An online calculator is available at: https://csm.ouproj.org.il. 


## Features

* The codes cover the following point groups: Cs, Ci, Cn (n>=2), Sn (n= 2,4,6,â€¦).
* Input structures can be in the form of a single molecule, concatenated file with multiple structures and a directory of molecules.
* When connectivity data is missing, OpenBabel is used to deduce it.

### Available commands
* comfile - Provide a command file for running calculations
* read - Read a molecule file into a json in CSM format
* write - Output the results of the calculation to a file. Must be used with piped input
* exact - Perform an exact CSM calculation for small-to-medium size molecules in xyz, mols, sdf and pdb file format. 
* approx - Approximate the CSM value. Relevant for protein homomers  in pdb file format. Partially tested for large molecules as well.
* trivial - Use the unit permutation to calculate the CSM for molecules and protein homomers.

## Usage

Input data requires a molecular geometry file and a choice of a point group
After installation, the program can be called from the command line. For example, to calculate the measure with respect to the C<sub>2</sub> point group one should type:

'csm  exact c2 -- input input_mol.sdf --output output_dir --keep-structure'

For a list of all available options type `csm --help`

In addition to the possibility of using CSM from the command line, CSM can be accessed programmatically through its API. Details are in the file API.md (including examples).

## Installation

CSM can be installed on Windows and Linux machines.


### Build Instructions: Windows

Install [OpenBabel 3.1.1](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases/tag/openbabel-3-1-1)  
Test open babel with the command: `obabel -H` , if it doesn't work, try to restart your computer.  

From within the python folder, run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Run the build cython commands:  
`python\csm\CPP_wrapper> python .\setup.py build`  
`python\cython-munkres> .\rebuild.bat`  



### Build Instructions: Linux

The easiest way to install the CSM is through [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/teamcsm/csm/tags).

Because installing openbabel correctly is a delicate and bug-prone process, an alternative method of installing CSM is available using Conda, and is described in the file conda_install_instructions.txt
